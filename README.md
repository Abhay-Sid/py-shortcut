## py-shortcut: Your Personal Command-Line Launcher

Tired of navigating endless folders? py-shortcut is a powerful tool that lets you create custom shortcuts for frequently accessed files and folders, dramatically increasing your workflow efficiency.  Think of it as a supercharged Windows Run command, but entirely customizable to your needs.

**Imagine this:** You have multiple project folders, assets, and files you access constantly. Instead of hunting them down in File Explorer, you can assign a custom shortcut (e.g., `wf` for "work folder") to each location.  Type `wf` into py-shortcut, press Enter, and *bam*â€”your work folder opens instantly!

**Key Features:**

* **Customizable Shortcuts:** Create shortcuts for any file or folder with a simple key assignment.
* **Lightning-Fast Access:** Open your frequently used resources in seconds.
* **Intuitive Interface:** Easy-to-use command-line interface.
* **Automatic JSON Management:**  py-shortcut automatically creates and manages a JSON file to store your shortcuts, ensuring seamless data handling.
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works across different operating systems.

**Getting Started:**

1.  **Download and run** the py-shortcut application.
2.  To add a shortcut, use the command `:add_key`. 
3.  Enter your desired **key** (e.g., `wf`)
4.  Enter the **file/folder path**, using double forward slashes (`//`) instead of backslashes (`\`). (you can skip this, now it supports both backslash and forward slash)
5.  Use the `help` command to view all available commands.

**Example:**

`:add_key wf //path/to/your/work/folder`

**Benefits for Creators:**

py-shortcut is a game-changer for creators who manage numerous projects, assets, and files.  By streamlining your workflow, you'll save valuable time and focus on what matters most: creating!

**Simple Setup:**

Just place the py-shortcut(along with TrunDictLower.py module) application in a convenient folder and create a desktop shortcut for easy access.  No complicated installations required!
