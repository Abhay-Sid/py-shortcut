# py-shortcut
Hi
this is a tools like windows run command but, in this tools you create your own shorcuts. for example 'imagine you a work folder that open often,  to open your work folder you locate it windows explorer every time' but here you can put file path of your 'work folder' and assign a key to it like "wf. now every time you open this tool and type 'wf' and 'press enter'. it will open you work folder directly. it much faster this way specially if you are a creator and you deal with multiple projet/assets folder and files.

to add your file/filder to the py-shortcut tool just use the **:add_key** command then type in the **key** then your file/folder path (use double forward slashes '//' instead of one backslash '\' in the file path because python work with forward slashes).
use **help** command to show all the useful commands.

this tool store all the keys and path in a json file, if now json file present file the directory it will automatically create one for you. just the tools in a folder and put a shortcut of the main file to hte desktop.
